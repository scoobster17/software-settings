Software Settings
=================

This repo is to store my personal settings for machines & software.

The reason for creating this repo is to make my settings freely available for myself, but please do have a look and copy them as you wish; it's all stuff I've learnt from the internet so you'd be able to find it all anyway :D

Also, if you have any tips or suggestions, please don't hesitate to let me know! I'm always interested to learn / improve / try new things. In this case (this repo), I would rather being educated via message etc rather than people submitting pull requests so I can learn by doing :)
